 \end{enumerate}

Connectivity in brain networks is not uniformly distributed. Network elements with high node degree – i.e., a large number of connections to other areas – are called `hubs'.
When hubs are more densely interconnected than expected by chance they form a `rich-club', the idea being that the richest members of the network (in terms of connections) are tightly connected to each other, thus forming a club.
These densely interconnected hubs are thought to promote efficient integration between anatomically distinct areas and play an important role in brain functioning.
It has been shown that hubs exhibit distinct transcriptional signatures in both humans \cite{Vertes2016a} and mice \cite{Fulcher2015}.
According to Fulcher \& Fornito \cite{Fulcher2015}, connections involving rich club hubs carry a distinctive genetic signature, which is driven by genes regulating the synthesis and breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) – the primary energetic substrate of neuronal signaling \cite{Fulcher2015}. These findings highlight a close relationship between metabolic expenditure and the high signaling load of hub regions in the brain, as has been previously proposed \cite{Bullmore2012}.
We therefore have some preliminary indications that the transcriptional signature of hubs may be a consistent feature of mammalian brain networks, but it is not known how distinctive this expression signature is; and in particular, whether it holds true for networks resolved at the scale of individual neurons and synapses.
To test this possibility, we aimed to replicate findings presented in \cite{Fulcher2015} using microscale connectivity data in C. elegans and gene expression data from WormBase.
We sought to determine whether hubs in the C. elegans connectome exhibit distinct gene expression patterns.\\

% METHODS: Outline (add what it's about)
To investigate the relationship between hub connectivity and gene expression in a micro-scale network we coupled two publicly available datasets containing synaptic-level connectivity network and gene expression signatures for the somatic nervous system of the \textit{C. elegans} hermaphrodite.\\

% METHODS: connectivity data
\textbf{Connectivity data}. Full neuron level connectivity data for 279 somatic neurons (282 nonpharyngeal neurons excluding VC6 and CANL/R neurons, which are missing connectivity data) were provided by Varshney et al. \cite{Varshney2011} and downloaded from the  \href{http://www.wormatlas.org/neuronalwiring.html#NeuronalconnectivityII}{wormatlas.org}). 
Corresponding 2D coordinates for 277 neurons (including VC06) were obtained from \href{www.biological-networks.org/?page_id=25}{biological-networks.org}). 
Positions for 3 neurons not included in this dataset (AIBL, AIYL, SMDVL) were reconstructed based on the positions of the contralateral neurons (AIBR, AIYR, SMDVR).  \\ 
In order to avoid any possible inherent differences in gene expression based on connectivity type we focused on binary chemical synapse network (M=1961 connections).
In the case of chemical synapses identities of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are well-defined, therefore each neuron is characterised with two binary vectors: one for incoming, second for outgoing connections, resulting in a directed connectivity matrix.


% METHODS: rich club analysis
\textbf{Network measures.} \\
\textit{Degree.} The total number of connections involving a given neuron is defined by its degree \textit{k} - the sum of incoming and outgoing connections $k=k_{in} + k_{out} $. 
The extended tail of the degree distribution presented in \ref{fig:SchematicRepresentation} indicates the existence of a small number of highly connected nodes. 
At each degree \textit{k} nodes in the network were classified as hubs (degree $>\textit{k}$) or non-hubs (degree $\leq\textit{k}$) and consequently all links between them separated into three categories: rich (hub $\rightarrow$ hub), feeder (hub $\rightarrow$ non-hub or non-hub $\rightarrow$ hub) and peripheral (non-hub $\rightarrow$ non-hub). \\
\textit{Rich club.} In order to examine, if high degree nodes then to preferentially connect to other high degree nodes, at each degree \textit{k} we calculated a rich-club coefficient (see eq. \ref{eq:RCcoef}).  
% RC coeficient formula 
 	\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:RCcoef}
     \mathrm{\Phi(\textit{k})} = \dfrac{2M_{>\textit{k}}}{N_{>\textit{k}}(N_{>\textit{k}}-1)}, 
	 \end{eqnarray}
where where $N_{>\textit{k}}$ is the number of nodes with degree $>\textit{k}$ and $M_{>\textit{k}}$ is the number of edges between them. \\
It quantifies the tendency of nodes with degree $\geq k$ to preferentially connect to each other by calculating how many edges are present between nodes of degree at least \textit{k}, normalized by how many edges there could be between these nodes in a complete graph.  
Rich club coefficient monotonically increases with degree as only nodes with degree >\textit{k} are retained and this alone yields a higher expected density of a sub-graph, therefore a normalised rich-club coefficient (\ref{eq:RCnormcoef}) is used in order to define, whether this increase in the empirical network is higher that could be expected by chance alone.  

\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:RCnormcoef}
     \mathrm{\Phi_{\textit{norm}}(\textit{k})} = \dfrac{\Phi(\textit{k})}{\Phi_{\textit{random}}(\textit{k})}, 
	 \end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi_{\textit{random}}(\textit{k})$ is the average value of $\Phi(\textit{k})$ across random networks. 
$\Phi_{norm}> 1$ indicates the rich-club organisation of the network.  \\
In order to calculate the normalised rich club coefficient $\Phi_{norm}$ we computed a 1000 random networks rewiring each edge an average of 50 times per null network and evaluated the ratio between rich club coefficient in the empirical $\Phi(k)$ and random $\Phi_{random}(k)$ resulting in $\Phi_{norm}(k)$ at each degree threshold.
Statistical significance for $\Phi_{norm}$ was estimated by computing P value directly from the empirical null distribution under the null hypothesis $\Phi(\textit{k}) \leq \Phi_{\textit{random}}(\textit{k})$. \\
Rich club coefficient and null networks were generated using the rich\textunderscore club\textunderscore bd and randmio\textunderscore dir functions from the Brain Connectivity Toolbox \cite{Rubinov2010} respectively.

% NOTE THAT TOWLSON USED UNDIRECTED (CHEMICAL+ELECTRICAL) network. WE USE DIRECTED CHEMICAL. (should probably put this into results - not in methids). 
%The phenomenon of the rich-club organisation in \textit{C. elegans} connectome was originally demonstrated by Towlson et al. \cite{Towlson2013} in an undirected binary version of the connectome where data for both chemical and electrical synapses were combined.
%As a result, a small number of high degree nodes forming a rich club was identified.  

% METHODS: gene expression
\textbf{Gene expression.}
Gene expression signatures for each neuron were obtained from the publicly available WormBase database \href{ftp://ftp.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/releases/WS256/ONTOLOGY/anatomy_association.WS256.wb}{(http://wormbase.org, release WS256)} on 6 February 2017. 
The dataset contains binary expression profiles for 948 genes annotated to at least one neuron. 
To minimise noise in the dataset we selected genes that were directly annotated to a specific neuron and labelled with the following qualifiers in the anatomy association file: certain, enriched, partial, blank. 
Each neuron on average is associated with the expression of 30 genes (range: 3 to 138 genes), while each gene is expressed on average in 9 out of 279 neurons (range: 1 to 148 neurons).     
It is important to note that, because the absence of expression data not recorded in the database, it is not possible to distinguish between the following two cases: (i) ``gene is not expressed'' and (ii) ``there is no information on whether gene is expressed''.
Both cases are recorded and analyzed as ``0'' expression here.\\
Gene expression was assigned to neurons based on anatomical hierarchy obtained from ...\\
PROBABLY SHOULD ADD INFORMATION ABOUT HIERARCHY FILE HERE as it's also from the wormbase (how/when downloaded/what queries were used \\
BEN, can you add information?

% METHODS: gene coexpression
\textbf{Gene coexpression.}\\
Genetic analysis in this paper focused on patterns of coupled gene expression between pairs of neurons rather than the presence or absence of gene expression in any single neuron on its own. 
In order to evaluate the similarity in gene expression profiles between each pair of neurons (\textit{i},\textit{j}) we calculated a measure of gene coexpression as a mean square contingency coefficient, $\phi$, between their binary expression profiles, which is a binary version of the traditional Pearson correlation coefficient.  
$\phi$ values range from $-1$ to $+1$, where $\pm1$ indicates perfect agreement or disagreement respectively, and 0 indicates no relationship. \\
As the number of genes expressed in each neuron varies in a broad range, we aimed to choose a measure of similarity between binary gene expression profiles which is not sensitive to the ratio between the number of ones and zeros in a vector. 
Mean square contingency coefficient $\phi$ met this criterion best. 
In contrast, other measures such as Jaccard index, Yule's Q, Yule's Y and Simple matching coefficients are highly dependent on this ratio. 
For example, Yule's Q, Yule's Y coefficients on average tend to reach extreme values when the ratio between the number of ones and zeros in a vector is large (e.g. 1:20). 
Simple matching coefficient, on the other hand, shows a steady increase with increasing ratio.     
Therefore, a relatively scenario-free measure $\phi$ was highly preferable to others.     \\

The effect of spatial distance on gene coexpression \cite{Fulcher2015} was evaluated. 
We calculated the distance between each pair of neurons based on their 2D coordinates and estimated the relationship between this distance and coexpression. 
No clear relationship was found (plot in supplementary??), therefore no coexpression-distance corrections were applied (maybe include the plot in supplementary?). \\
In the C. elegans connectome, 92 out of 118 classes of neurons have bilateral representation, meaning that each of those neuron classes have both left and right counterparts (e.g. AVAL, AVAR). 
Apart from their anatomical resemblance, these neurons tend to have very similar gene expression signature with a mean coexpression value of 0.98. 
To ensure that our analyses are not influenced by this symmetry, coexpression values between the pairs of symmetrical neurons were excluded from all further analyses.

 \end{figure}

% METHODS: gene enrichment
\textbf{Gene enrichment.}
It was particularly important to determine, which functional groups of genes contribute to the increased coexpression between: (i) connected pairs of neurons as compared to unconnected pairs as well as (ii) connections involving hubs (rich and feeder) compared to connections that do not involve hubs (peripheral). \\
First, for each gene we determined the pattern of matching expression profiles (a match meaning that a gene is expressed by both neurons) between each pair of neurons resulting in a binary 279 x 279 matrix.
Then, for each gene we calculated a cumulative binomial probability of getting more matches $(X)$ than in the empirical data $(m)$ on a particular connection type (see eq. \ref{eq:CBinomialProbability}). 
Depending on the connection type in question this can be phrased in two following ways: (i) what is the probability to get more matches on connected links given the number of connected links; (ii) what is the probability to get more matches on links involving hubs (rich and feeder) given the number of matches on connected links. 
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:CBinomialProbability}
     \mathrm{P(X>m)} = 1 - \sum_{\textit{i}=0}^{m}\binom{n}{i} p^{\textit{i}}(1-p^{n-\textit{i}}), 
\end{eqnarray}
where m - the number of matches in empirical data, \textit{p} - the probability of randomly choosing a selected type of connection and \textit{n} - a maximum number of possible matches given the connection type in question. \\
Therefore, each gene was given a score (p value - gene coexpression contribution (GCC) score), where lower GCC corresponds to higher contribution towards increased correlation. 
Whan calculating GCC for connected links more then one match for a gene overall was required (as a result 577 genes out of 948 left); when calculating GCC for the links involving hubs (rich and feeder links) more than one match was required on connected links (as a result 390 out of 948 genes left).    
Otherwise, no information about the contribution of a specific gene to the overall coexpression pattern could be extracted. 
\textbf{(NOTE: not literally true as both on and off matches equally contribute to an increase in coexpression, - need to find a way how to explain, why non-expression matches are not taken into account here).} \\
These GCC scores were then used to perform gene score resampling (GSR) analysis, which examines if genes with low GCC scores are statistically over-represented in any functional category. 

The above mentioned analysis was done using 3.0.2 of ErmineJ \cite{Gillis2010}. 
Gene annotations were assigned from GO \cite{Ashburner2000} using an annotation file from GEMMA \cite{Zoubarev2012}.  
Generic\textunderscore worm \textunderscore noParents.an.txt.gz downloaded using a build-in option within ErmineJ software on February 10 2017.

In the analysis we were considering gene set sizes in the range 5–100, taking the mean score in a GO group to summarize it.

\subsection*{Coexpression and connectivity}

%% for now figres are old - just to define where the figure is
First, we investigated how gene coexpression relates to connectivity by examining it between connected and unconnected neuron pairs.
As it is shown in Fig \ref{ConUncon}, connected pairs of neurons have more similar expression profiles than unconnected pairs (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, $P < 10^{-50}$). Furthermore, there is no difference in gene coexpression between reciprocally and unidirectionally connected neurons while coexpression in both of these groups is higher than between unconnected neurons (see Fig \ref{S1_Fig}). \\

\begin{figure}[!h]
   \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ConUnconChemicalFINAL}
 \caption{{\bf Coexpression between connected and unconnected neurons.} 
Distribution of transcriptional similarity between connected and unconnected neurons. P-values are from Wilcoxon rank sum test.}
 \label{ConUncon}
 \end{figure}
To investigate which functional groups of genes contributed to the difference in transcriptional coupling between connected and unconnected neurons, we used a method of assigning each gene coexpression contribution (GCC) score that quantifies the contribution of each gene to the overall coexpression between neuron pairs (see Methods).  \\ 

%% comment on enrichment analysis. No write up can be done before deciding on options. 
\textbf{NOTE: Do GRS in all cases - exclude genes with $<=$ 1 matches (genes with 1 match introduce more noise then effect) on the mask. 
Enrichment results depend on the size of gene sets selected: \\
5-100 give same results for both connected and rich-feeder (glutamate plus connectivity)\\
10-100 give only one category for connected (basic connectivity) and more of the same stuff for rich and feeder (no glutamate as glutamate category is a small one).
We get sensible results only when -log(score) option is selected. 
Otherwise connected links get sensory categories related to light detection.}. 

The majority of the significant ($P < 0.05$) GO categories are related to neuronal connectivity and communication, as listed in table \ref{table1} (1st column: GO category). 
These findings are in line with our expectations as they confirm that genes that are more likely to be expressed in a pair of connected neurons are in fact related to neuronal connectivity and communication.\\
\textbf{NOTE: As coexpression is increased in for both "on" and "off" matches, we might present a list for enrichment in 2 cases: ON matches (genes, that need to be both on to increase coexpression for a certain group of links), OFF matches (genes that need to be both off to increase coexpression for a certain group of links). 
Would separate meaning of ON and OFF and wouldn't mislead the reader. }

\subsection*{Properties of hub connectivity}
%% INTRODUCE RICH CLUB  hene and focus on the difference between rich/feeder/peripheral links below
\textbf{Rich club organisation of the connectome.}\\

Connectivity is not distributed evenly throughout the \textit{C. elegans} nervous system.  
Some neurons have a very high number of connections and, therefore, act as hubs in the network. 
When hubs in the network are more densely interconnected than expected by chance, they form a rich-club - a sub-network of high degree nodes that share a disproportionally high number of connections between themselves. 
The phenomenon of a rich-club in \textit{C. elegans} nervous system was first established by Towlson et al. \cite{Towlson2013} using an undirected binary connectivity matrix where both chemical and electrical synapses were combined. \\
In this work we use a directed binary connectivity matrix of chemical synapses provided by Varshney et al. \cite{Varshney2011} for 279 non-pharingeal neurons (nodes) and 1961 connections between them (edges) and show a rich-club organisation of the chemical synapse network (see \textit{Materials and Methods}). 
Rich-club organisation manifests across a continuous range of degrees $41<k<58$ ($P<0.05$, shaded grey area in Fig.\ref{RCcoef}) as normalised rich-club coefficient $\Phi_{norm}>1$. 
This indicates that when nodes are defined as hubs (degree $>\textit{k}$) in this range, they are more densely interconnected than expected by chance.
Rich club in the chemical synapse network consists of 13 high degree neurons with degree $42 \leq k \leq 98$. \\
\textbf{(NOTE: maybe include a list with degrees and definitions in SUPP (like in Towlson's paper?)).}

\textbf{Coexpression and hub connectivity.}\\
For the second part of our analysis, we focused on the features of rich-club organization of \textit{C. elegans} connectome by investigating the relationship between gene coexpression and neuronal connectivity in three different classes of neuron pairs.
At each node degree, $k$ (x-axis in Fig \ref{RCdegree}), we defined each neuron as either a hub (nodes with degree $\geq k$) or a nonhub (otherwise), and then labelled each connection as rich (hub $\rightarrow$ hub), feeder (nonhub $\rightarrow$ hub or hub $\rightarrow$ nonhub), or peripheral (nonhub $\rightarrow$ nonhub). 
Then at each degree, we calculated median coexpression values for each link type (Fig. \ref{RCdegree}). 
Median was chosen instead of the mean due to non-normal coexpression value distributions.
Coexpression is gradually increasing with degree for links involving hubs (Fig. \ref{RCdegree}). 
Rich links show consistently increasing coexpression for a range of degrees until it reaches plateau at around $k=38$ and stays constant in the topological rich club regime. 
Median coexpression also increases slightly for feeder links from around the same threshold $k=38$, while pthe curve for peripheral links remain flat through the range of degrees.

To investigate which functional groups of genes contributed to the increased coexpression for links involving hubs (rich and feeder) we used a method of assigning each gene a GCC measure that quantifies the contribution of each gene (see Methods).

Enrichment analysis show that the majority of the significant ($P < 0.05$) GO categories are related to glutamate signalling, neuronal connectivity and communication. It is line with the previous analysis where same GO categories were shown to be significant in differentiating connected from unconnected neurons.

These findings are in line with our expectations as high degree neurons are highly involved in signalling and the majority of hubs while being cholinergic, receive input from sensory neurons the majority of which is glutamatergic. \\
NOTE: NOTE HERE ABOUT REDUCED LIST OF GENES IN EACH ANALYSIS (577 and 390 genes for connected and R/F respectively) AND WHAT IMPACT THAT COULD HAVE ON RESULTS. 

\subsection*{EXTRAS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Difference between interneurons/motor/sensory neurons - effect driven by interneurons}
    \item{Maybe include lineage data: lineage distance increases with degree for feeder links; no difference between rich and peripheral links; Sort of confirms separation into rich/feeder/peripheral links as distance increases for feeders?}
\end{itemize} 
\subsection*{Neuron type}
While above we demonstrated a relationship between transcriptional similarity and structural connectivity, we note that all hubs in the topological rich-club regime in the C. elegans connectome are interneurons.
Correspondingly, we investigated whether the effect of increasing gene coexpression is specific to interneurons.
The relationship between median coexpression and degree for connections including different types of neurons (interneurons, motor neurons and sensory neurons) is shown in Fig. \ref{NeuronTypePlot}.
Connections involving interneurons show a pattern of increasing average coexpression with increasing degree, however neither connections involving motor nor sensory neurons resemble this trend; even showing evidence for the opposite relationship.
In other words, motor and sensory neurons with higher degree show less similar gene expression patterns.

\subsection*{Modules}
\textbf{Chemical BINARY}\\
Changing tau value can get from 4 to 6 modules:\\
4 modules: \\
* 95\% of RC links are within one module (module 3), which is dominated by motor neurons \\
* 5\% RC links within module 2 \\
No RC links between modules. \\
module 4 - small motor neuron module. \\

5 modules: \\
trends the same, 2 small modules originates. \\
all RC links are within modules. \\

6 modules:\\
* 45 \% RC links within module 3\\
* 5 \% and 5 \% RC links in modules 2 and 4. 
Major module (module 3) dominated by motor neurons. 
around 45 \% RC links connect different modules. \\
as the number of modules increases, more RC links tend to connect different modules between themselves (instead of connecting nodes within a module) \\
Modules with the most of RC links have highest coexpression despite having longest connection distances. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{modules}

1st row: 4 modules (tau=0.2). 2nd row: 5 modules (tau=0.3). 3rd row (tau=0.5). }
 \label{Modules}
 \end{figure}

\textbf{Chemical WEIGHTED}\\
for a range of tau thresholds (0.1-0.5), same result: \\
7 modules. \\
* 60\% RC links are within module 1\\
* 5\% RC links are within module 3\\
* 35 \% of RC links connect different modules between themselves. \\

There are four really small modules, three of them purely motor neuron modules (5.6.7). 
Module 1 - high proportion of motor neurons! module distributed through the body. 
around 50 \% of feeder links link different modules; another half link nodes within 1 and 4 modules. 
Module 1 has highest coexpression despite having highest connection cost (longest distances)
